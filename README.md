I have created, debugged, and enhanced components for this app using Microsoft Copilot. 
I asked to generate a basic razor component for the Event Card, which include fields for event name, date, and location. 
Then, I implemented two-way data binding and created navigation links between the event list, details, and registration pages.
I asked to verify routing paths, ensuring best practices.
I asked to do validation to ensure only valid data is processed in the Event Card.
I asked to update routing logic to gracefully handle invalid paths and optimize performance by improving how event data is rendered.
I asked for a separate registration form with data validation for user input (name and email).
Then I asked for state management to track user sessions and an attendance tracker to monitor event participation.
Finally I asked to remove unnecessary dependencies.

A persistent bug is preventing me from registering to any of the event (the validation always believes the name and email fields are empty)
but after over 4 hours stuck on that bug, with over 20 "quick fixes" from Copilot that changed nothing, I just decided to push this online and move on.
Thanks for your understanding.
